Features
User Authentication: Secure sign-up, login, and logout.
JWT-Based Authentication: Stateless authentication with JWT tokens.
Password Hashing: Secures user passwords using bcrypt.
Protected Routes: Routes that are accessible only to authenticated users.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions with token expiry.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-auth-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd mern-auth-project
Install backend dependencies:
npm install
Navigate to the client folder and install frontend dependencies:

cd client
npm install
Set up your environment variables (see Environment Variables).
Technologies
Frontend: React, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt for password encryption

How It Works
User Registration: A user can register by providing a username, email, and password. The password is hashed using bcrypt before being saved to the database.

Login: After login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the user. The token is stored in the browser's localStorage or sessionStorage.

Protected Routes: For any protected route, the JWT is verified on the server side before granting access.

Logout: User can log out by clearing the JWT token from storage.

npm install cors
And then use it in your Express app:

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
Database Connection Errors: Make sure your MongoDB URI is correct in your .env file. If you face connection issues, verify the database credentials.

Token Storage: Store tokens in secure storage mechanisms like HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks, rather than localStorage/sessionStorage if high security is required.

Run Locally
Start the backend server:


npm run server
Start the React client:


cd client
npm start
Environment Variables
You will need to set up the following environment variables:

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.
JWT_SECRET: A secret key for signing JWT tokens.
PORT: The port for running the backend server (default is 5000).
Example .env file:

plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/auth
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
PORT=5000
